## Security Review Disclaimer

While a smart contract security review aims to identify vulnerabilities, it cannot eliminate all risks. This process is limited by the time, resources, and expertise, and absolute security cannot be ensured. No responsibility is taken for any issues, losses, or damages that may arise after the review, whether vulnerabilities are identified or not. To strengthen the security of a project, it is strongly recommended to conduct additional audits, launch bug bounty programs, and implement ongoing on-chain monitoring.

# Risk Classification

| Severity               | Impact: High | Impact: Medium | Impact: Low |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| **Likelihood: High**   | Critical     | High           | Medium      |
| **Likelihood: Medium** | High         | Medium         | Low         |
| **Likelihood: Low**    | Medium       | Low            | Low         |

## Impact

- High - leads to a significant material loss of assets in the protocol or significantly harms a group of users.

- Medium - leads to a moderate material loss of assets in the protocol or moderately harms a group of users.

- Low - leads to a minor material loss of assets in the protocol or harms a small group of users.

## Likelihood

- High - attack path is possible with reasonable assumptions that mimic on-chain conditions, and the cost of the attack is relatively low compared to the amount of funds that can be stolen or lost.

- Medium - only a conditionally incentivized attack vector, but still relatively likely.

- Low - has too many or too unlikely assumptions or requires a significant stake by the attacker with little or no incentive.

## Action required for severity levels

- Critical - Must fix as soon as possible (if already deployed).

- High - Must fix (before deployment if not already deployed).

- Medium - Should fix.

- Low - Could fix.
